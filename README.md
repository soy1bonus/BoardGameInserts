# BoardGameInserts
Blender templates to build printable boardgame inserts.

The magic is made in **InsertsTemplate.blend** in which I've created a few *Geometry Nodes* that allow me to procedurally create the insert.

Then I've uploaded some inserts that I've been printing successfully with an *Ender 3 v3 SE*. You can use those as a template on how to build you own inserts.

I basically use two nodes:
- **Insert_Drawer:** which creates a drawer that can be used for cards, tiles, and other componens.
- **Insert_Divider:** which creates a card divider that can be used for other purposes if needed.
